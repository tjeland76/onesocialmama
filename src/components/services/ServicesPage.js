        <h2>Services</h2>

        <p>Please see below for the core packages offered by One Social Mama; we can tailor our packages to suit your individual needs. Please do get in touch if you have any questions.</p>
        <p>Our core packages are detailed below:</p>

        <a name="audit"></a>
        <h3>Audit</h3>
        <p>For small to medium sized businesses who would benefit from a review on how they can improve their social media channels, and confirm areas which are performing well versus those that need improvements. This would include both a platform review, including brand, tone, content, successes and improvement areas; and an analytics review showing which posts are both engaging and value add, and why.</p>
        <p>This insight gives you a great view of what is working well, and what isn’t working as well, to help you build your brand strategy and improve your performance.</p>

        <a name="strategy"></a>
        <h3>Strategy Development</h3>

        <p>This can be hugely beneficial for those seeking some guidance on running their social media channels, and maximising their effectiveness. We will work with you to develop a strategy to align the focus of the business and its objectives across social media channels.</p>
        <p>This will include a written strategy document covering areas such as defining a target audience, recommended platforms, posting times, posting volumes, recommended tone, influencers, content strategy, KPI’s to track successes and how to report on these.</p>
        <p>This written strategy document is a great foundation to help you run your social media and increase your social media performance.</p>

      <h3>Social Media Workshops and One to One’s</h3>
        <h4>Workshops</h4>
        <p>We run bespoke training workshops on relevant social media channels for you or your team on how to use them to maximise your business,, so you can take the learnings and apply it yourself. Please do get in touch for more details how we can support you further.</p>
        <p>These are great for those wanting to keep their social media in house but would benefit from some extra guidance on how to maximise their social media channels.</p>
        <h4>One to One's</h4>
        <p>These are a really good opportunity to ‘Speak Social’.  Whatever questions you have around your social media channels, we can chat through this and answer any specific questions or training areas you have. These are great for small businesses who run their own social media but every so often would benefit from a little support.</p>

        <h3>Social Media Management</h3>
        <p>There are various ways we can work with you, to help manage your social media channels for you,  tailoring our packages for your needs;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We can work with you in setting up your social media channels and helping you select the right channels and strategy for your business, leaving you with social media channels set up and ready to go for you to manage yourselves within an ongoing strategy.</li>
          <li>We can work with you to optimise your existing channels and ensure your social media is growing and achieving your objectives, whether this is to build brand awareness, an engaged community, website traffic or email sign ups.</li>
          <li>We can manage all your social media for you so you can get on with what you do best.  We understand to manage social media well takes time, and lets face it, there just aren’t enough hours in the day!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CV and Interview Skills</h3>
        <p>For mums (and dads) returning to work after a period of time raising children, it can be daunting preparing to return to the workplace.</p>
        <h4>CVs</h4>
        <p>We offer support with preparing and updating your cv, ensuring your cv is current, relevant and  shows off your true capability and potential. Your cv should also demonstrate how you match the requirements of your desired roles. We can also help with preparing a great covering letter, explaining your recent gap in employment, and your desire to return to work.</p>
        <h4>Interview Skills</h4>
        <p>This can seem like one of the most daunting tasks after being out of work raising children! We can help prepare you for interviews ahead, help you understand what is required from you, prepare you in terms of likely questions and format of the interview, ensuring you feel confident and prepared, and ready to show off your very best self.</p>

        <h3>Flexible working</h3>
        <p>For mums (and dad’s) in employment, getting the right working hours can quite simply make the difference between being able to work or not. We can support you with making a flexible working request, understanding the different flexible working options available, how to put a thorough case forward to your employer, whilst supporting you in terms of flexible working legislation and policy.</p>
