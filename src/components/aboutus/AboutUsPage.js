            <p>One Social Mama is a Social Media and HR consultancy founded and directed by Emily Eland. Emily lives and works in Cuddington, Cheshire and has a background in HR and Social Media.</p>
            <p>Emily has worked in HR for over 15 years having gained a Psychology and Business Management BA Hons Degree (Leeds University), and a Certificate in Personnel and Development (Leeds Metropolitan University).</p>
            <p>After having some time out of HR, following the birth of her 3 children, Emily has retrained and followed a passion of hers in terms of social media and gained a qualification in Strategic Social Media Management with Digital Mums.</p>
            <p>After becoming a mum Emily became increasingly aware of the difficulties of finding flexible work around her children, which is the fundamental vision which Digital Mums is based upon. Co Founders Kathyrn Tyler and and Nikki Cochrane have one big goal which is to help every mum to achieve their work life balance, something they call #workthatworks. Digital mums want to change the way flexible work is seen, and to help drive government policy and cultural shifts in this area to help mums back into work.</p>
            <p>Emily is a huge advocate of helping mums back into work, and runs a blog called <a href="https://fleximamablog.wordpress.com/" target="window">Fleximama</a>. Fleximama encourages and supports mums back into work, supporting them in their quest to find flexible work that fits around their families. You can follow fleximama on <a href="https://twitter.com/mamacanflex" target="window">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mamacanflex/" target="window">Facebook</a>.</p>
            <p>Emilyâ€™s belief is that #mamacan and with encouragement and direction we can all achieve what we want to achieve and be the best we can we.</p>
            <p>Emily has founded One Social Mama (hence the name!), which is a Social Media Consultancy to help small to medium sized businesses to be the best they can be. One Social Mama offer a variety of social media support from audits, strategy development, bespoke workshops and 121's  to full social media management.</p>
            <p>Emily believes in making things work as best as they can, whilst where possible using as less resource as possible, working to ensure maximum results.  Social media is a great example of this. Done well this can be a foundation of success for businesses, but done badly can be wasted and ineffective use of time and results.</p>
            <p>With an estimated new social media user every 15 seconds, Social Media is an area where One Social Mama can support clients to build their brand, build an engaged community and ultimately increase their customer base.</p>
            <p>Social Media support means businesses can focus their efforts on what they do best, and being the best they can be.</p>
